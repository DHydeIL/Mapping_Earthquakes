# Mapping Earthquakes
Using Leaflet.js and geoJson files from [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php), I've created an [index.html](Earthquake_Challenge/index.html) that host a map of earthquakes that have occured in the last 7 days. The map has three base layers showing a street, satellite, and dark view, as well as three layers that show all earthquakes and their magnitudes, the tectonic plate lines, and the major earthquakes with their magnitudes.
